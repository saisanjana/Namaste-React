1. What is the difference between names eport, default export and export * as?
Named exports are given a name and they can be imported by that name only in other files. We can export 
multiple values using named exports.
e.x we can export a variable and a function:
export myFunc = () =>{}
exprot myVar = 34

These are exports that are marked as default and can be imported using any name in another module.
There can be only one default export in a file.
export default const var = 56

This syntax allows you to re-export all named exports from another module under a new namespace. 
For example, if you have a module called utils.js that exports several named functions, 
you can re-export them under a new namespace like this:
export * as utils from './utils';

2.what is the importance of config.js file?
We may end up using a single piece of data in many files. Initialising it in every file will be a
tedious process if something needs to be changed in the data later. Rather we can put all the constants
in a a single file like config.js and export them. Then they can be imported wherever they are needed.

3.What are react hooks?
Hooks in React are functions that allow functional components to have stateful behavior,
lifecycle methods, and access to context objects. They provide a way to reuse stateful logic and
behavior between different components without the need for class-based components or higher-order 
components.

4.Why do we need use state hook?
The useState hook provides a way to add stateful behavior to functional components by allowing them 
to have a local state that can be updated and cause a re-render. The hook returns an array with 
two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state.
