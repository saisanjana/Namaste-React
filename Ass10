1. All ways of writing css
-> index.css 
-> inline css
-> styled components
-> component Libraries

2. How do we configure tailwind
-> First we have to install tailwind and postcss. Postcss is a package to convert tailwind classes to
native css classes.
-> We have initialise tailwind so that it creates tailwinf config file. We have to give the 'content'
property of the config file to which files use tailwind css.
-> we have to configure .postcssrc file to tell bundler to compile the css classes while building.
-> import tailwind in index.css
-> and then start using the base components of the tailwind framework

3. What are things present in tailwind config file?
'content' -> specify the files to scan which uses tailwind
'theme' -> to configure key value pairs which define specific values for each category like colors spacing typography and more
'extend' -> configuration to extend or override the default set of styles provided by tailwind
'plugins' -> configuration to extend the tailwinds functionality like utilities
